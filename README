This is a simple SQLite3 wrapper for objective-c.  It supports executing, parametrized executing, and getting results from queries (aka executing).  To open a SQLite3 database file, use this line of code:

   ANSQLite3Manager * man = [[ANSQLite3Manager alloc] initWithDatabaseFile:@"/var/tmp/test.db"];

Since every SQL query has a result, you can Read the output of a query into an array of dictionaries like this:

   NSArray * results = [man executeQuery:@"SELECT * FROM table"];

And of course SQL isn't anything without security.  That's why I decided to make a parametrized option as well.  Simply pass an NSArray full of NSString NSData and NSNumber objects as the substitutions for the ?'s in your query string:

   BOOL b = [man executeQuery:@"INSERT INTO sessions (name, contents) VALUES (?, ?)" 
             withParameters:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:name, _contents, nil]];

And close it by either releasing your manager, or calling -closeDatabase.  Thanks for reading, and enjoy ;)
